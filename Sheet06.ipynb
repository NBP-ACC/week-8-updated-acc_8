    "In this exercise sheet you will start to analyse neural time series data, i.e. EEG Data. As introduction to 'real' EEG data anaylsis, we will first create and work with artificial signals, in order to better understand the processing procedures. Step by step, we will make our signal more complex, approxiamting real EEG data. Next week, we will then start to take this knowledge in order analyse real EEG Data, recorded by a Neurobiopsychology research group of our institute.\n",
